# Tech Cookbook / Cheat-Sheet:

## General Hackathon Info

### Connect to Slack

First things first, you'll want to connect to the Slack space for the hackathon.  The invitation link will be sent to you or feel free to contact any NCBI person who can help.  For the fastest and best support on the information in this document, Slack is your best bet.  Look for a `#help-desk` channel once you have connected.

### Create an ssh key and connect to all the things.

#### Setting up a terminal environment

You need an ssh key to connect to github and to access servers. There are different ways to do that; this document outlines how to use a command line for these tasks.

Depending on your operating system of choice, you may already have a command line (terminal) and ssh-related tools installed (Mac, most Linux versions, newer Windows versions).  

If not, you can install Git software from 

* [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

(This will install on Windows machines fine even without administrator access.)

Once you have git installed (it'll appear as 'git bash'), run it to open a command window.  On a mac, open "terminal". On linux, open a bash shell or your shell of choice.



### Public Keys
        
For access to GitHub and Hackathon Servers, you'll need an _ssh key_.

* Feel free to read about [Generating a new SSH Key for Github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/), or follow the steps below.

1. Open the terminal.

2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

    > `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`

    This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label (`-C` = comment).

    > Note: For github keys, it's customary to use the same email as your github account. For shell access, any string will do in the comment, with `something@something-else`.  The `something` before the `@` will be your username for connecting to cloud servers.

3. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

    > `Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]`

    Optional: if you already have existing keys, you may want to give this pair a specific name.  

4. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. 

    > `Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]`

    > `Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]`

    You'll see a message indicating your key has been saved, with a default public key name of `id_rsa.pub` in your `.ssh` folder.

### Adding Keys to Github and Gaining Server Access

Now that you have created an ssh key, you need to tell Github about it and provide it to the server / cloud admins so they can grant you access.   Here's how to do that.

#### Adding Keys to Github

1. Log into Github
2. Click your avatar in the top right corner of the screen, and choose "settings" from the menu.
3. On the left side, click "SSH and GPG Keys".  You may be prompted for your password if you've been logged in for a while.
4. Click the green "New SSH Key" button at the top of the screen.
5. Locate the `id_rsa.pub` file you created previously (or any other custom-named public key).  Copy the entire contents of the file and paste it into the "Key" box.  Enter any string in the "Title" box as a name/label, and click "Add SSH Key" to save.
6. For write access to the hackathon repository, you need to provide your github username to the github admin - to do that, send a message in the `#github_usernames` channel in Slack.
7. Once you are added, you'll get an invitation email.  Open it, click the green button, and accept the invitation.
8. Finally, open the github repository page, and click the "clone or download" button.  Copy the ssh github url (it'll look like `git@github.com:NCBI-Hackathons/TheHumanPangenome.git`), open a command prompt, and try the following command:

    > `git clone git@github.com:NCBI-Hackathons/TheHumanPangenome.git`

Enter your ssh key passphrase if prompted.  If the repo is cloned - success!

#### Server Access

To get cloud server access, you need to provide your ssh public key to the server admin.  To do that:

1. Copy the contents of your `id_rsa.pub` file to a new message in the `#public-keys` slack channel.
2. Once your key is added, a friendly NCBI cloud admin will reply in Slack with a test command you can use to verify server access.  It'll be something like: `ssh yourusername@1.2.3.4 whoami`
3. Run that commnd in a terminal; it should respond with your username. 


* Server IP information is listed in the `#help-desk` channel in slack (pinned message).

* If you have trouble connecting, check the username, and try first with a simple command-line `ssh` client.

## Where’s the Data?!

|Data               |Location     |
|-------------------|--------------|
|SRA alignments| `gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/*.bam`|
| Counts | `gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/genecounts/*.genecounts` |
|Contig FASTAs| `gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/*.contigs.fa/`|
|BigQuery Tables|project: `strides-sra-hackathon-data` <br/>table: `rnaseq.genescounts`, `rnaseq.runinfo` <br>project: `strides-sra-hackathon-data`<br/>table: various, see 4a TODO: [below](#)|
|Server information| Refer to the pinned post Slack (`#help-desk` channel)|
|Additional Tools|`gs://ncbi_hackathon_aux_tools/`|

## How the data was generated
We start with SRA run data pulled from NCBI and align it with hisat2 onto gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/refs/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_plus_hs38d1_analysis_set.*.ht2
Unmapped reads then are assembled using skesa into denovo contigs and aligned with hisat2 onto the contigs. The merged BAM file is stored on the bucket. 
BAM files are sorted and indexed, for each BAM there is a flagstat and counts files. The counts are also stored in the BigQuery table rnaseq.genescounts.

## General GCP Advice
 
###  Working with Google Storage (aka `gs`) buckets:

* `gsutil` is a collection of command line tools to access and modify data stored in google storage buckets. [`gsutil` Documentation Link](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
        
* `gsutil` Examples:
    * List files:

      `gsutil ls -l`

      `gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/DRR016694*.bam`
        
    * Copy a file from the bucket to the current directory: 
    
      `gsutil cp gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/DRR016694.bam .`
        
    * Stream a file:

      `gsutil cat gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/DRR016694.flagstat | less`
        
    * Copy multiple files from the bucket:

      `gsutil -m cp gs://ncbi_sra_rnaseq/DRR01669\*.bam .`
    

> Tip: To copy data between servers, 
> * use gsutil to copy from the source server to google storage first, then copy to the destination.
> * or, add your ssh keys to the source server and use `scp localfile username@REMOTE-IP:/foo/bar/`


### Google compute cloud tools (gcloud):
        
* Check your service account and project: `gcloud info`
        
* Pub/sub queue:
  * Create a topic: `gcloud pubsub topics create test1`
            
  * Create a subscription to the topic: `gcloud pubsub subscriptions create --topic test1 sub1`
            
  * Publish a message to the topic: `gcloud pubsub topics publish test1 --message qwe`
            
  * Pull a message from the subscription: `gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull sub1`

   
### BigQuery (a.k.a bq)
        
* [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool)
        
> For reference use only -- _should not_ be included in an external docker
        
* Search data pre-indexed by NCBI
            
  * *Query format*: `bq --project_id strides-sra-hackathon-data query --nouse_legacy_sql`
                
    > In some case you may need to use `strides-sra-hackathon-data`, more on this below
            
* *Useful options*: 
    ```
    bq --max_rows=100 
       --format=pretty 
       --project_id strides-sra-hackathon-data query     
       --nouse_legacy_sql "<your_standard_sql_query_here"
       ```

> The format flag also takes “json” and “csv” as valid arguments
            

* *Available data*:
    `bq show --schema --format=prettyjson strides-sra-hackathon-data:rnaseq.runinfo`

> Format also accepts “json”


## Premade servers

Several servers are available.

* See the pinned post in the `#help-desk` channel in slack for server IP addresses. Contact a friendly admin for access or to request a new or modified (more CPU, memory, disk) server.

## Working with NCBI Data/Tools in the cloud

### SRA Realign Object Data and Contigs
        
Realigned metagenomic SRA runs are located in the `ncbi_sra_realign` bucket. To access them directly please refer to gsutil.
        
The bucket with realigned runs should be mounted on the VMs during the main hackathon event under the directory `/data/realign/`. Realign files are named based on their corresponding SRA run accession number, for example `/data/realign/SRR1158703.realign`

Realign objects are effectively the same reads (bases) as
the original SRA runs but aligned onto host (human) and
either viral contigs or references and onto denovo contigs
assembled with skesa. 

* For example, `SRR649927.realign` contains 964 reads mapped onto human, 9043281 reads mapped onto denovo contigs and 1392735 unmapped reads:
  ```
  bq --maxrows=10000 --projectid strides-sra-hackathon-data 
  query 'select * from ncbisrarealign.summary where accession="SRR649927"'
  ```

* To check taxonomy of the contigs:  
  ```
  bq --projectid strides-sra-hackathon-data 
  query 'select * from ncbisrarealign.taxonomy where accession="SRR649927"'`
  ```

* To extract contigs from a realign object:  
  ```
  dump-ref-fasta --localref SRR649927.realign > SRR649927.contigs.fa
  ```
* Human references GRCh38.p12 was used to align reads before assembling the rest. Please find the full list of sequences here:
  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly?term=GRCh38&cmd=DetailsSearch](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly?term=GRCh38&cmd=DetailsSearch)
        
* There are 2 types of contigs in realign objects: guided and denovo. Guided contigs have been built with guided  assembler using a predefined viral reference set. These are almost 300 sequences including multiple Influenza serotypes, Herpes, Ebola etc.

The names of guided contigscan be filtered based on regex:

`grep -P '^(?\!Contig)\[A-Z0-9.\]+_\\d+$'`

Contig names are based on reference sequence accession
used as a guide. For example contig named `KF021598.1_1`
has been built using `KF021598.1` as a guide reference.
        
Denovo contigs have been assembled with skesa after
filtering out human and viral reads. Their names start
with Contig prefix.
        
Contig names are unique only within a realign object, not
across realign objects.
    
### SRA Toolkit
        
(Already installed on pre-built hackathon VM instances) 

Download from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/toolkitsoft/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/toolkitsoft/)  

Or, copy the pre-release version from google storage:  

  `gsutil cp gs://ncbi_hackathon_aux_tools/sratoolkit.2.9.4.pre.tar.gz .`
        
* Examples:
  * Lookup by accession:  `srapath <accession>`
  * Download and cache run locally: `prefetch <accession>`
  * Get statistics: `sra-stat --quick --xml <accession>`
  * Dump reads into separate fastq files: `fastq-dump --split-files --split-spot <accession>`
  * Extract contigs (local sequences): `dump-ref-fasta -l <accession>`
  * Convert an SRA object to BAM:  `sam-dump --unaligned <accession> | samtools view -Sb -<accession>.bam`
    
### BLAST suite
        
Instructions on running the dockerized BLAST are at [https://github.com/ncbi/docker/blob/master/blast/README.md](https://github.com/ncbi/docker/blob/master/blast/README.md) 

> Make sure the BLAST_DIR env variable is set before you try the commands.

For a complete list of command-line blast arguments see: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279684/#_appendices_Options_for_the_commandline_a_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279684/#_appendices_Options_for_the_commandline_a_)
        
BLAST has a lot of flexibility in how it presents results:

* Use the `-outfmt` option to specify how the results are presented.
  * Default value for `-outfmt` is 0 (zero), which produces the standard BLAST report.
  * `-outfmt 6` produces a tabular report with a standard set of fields. 
  * `-outfmt 7` produces a tabular report with comment fields
  * `-outfmt 10` produces CSV.
  > To customize the fields in the tabular/CSV output, see examples in slides 6-8 of
    [https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/public_webinars/2018/10Oct03_Using_BLAST/Using_BLAST_Well2.pdf](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/public_webinars/2018/10Oct03_Using_BLAST/Using_BLAST_Well2.pdf)
            
  * Use `-outfmt 11` to save your results as a BLAST archive that you can then reformat with the
    `blast_formatter` application. See slide 9 in [https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/public_webinars/2018/10Oct03_Using_BLAST/Using_BLAST_Well2.pdf](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/public_webinars/2018/10Oct03_Using_BLAST/Using_BLAST_Well2.pdf)
        
BLAST Databases.
            
* To see BLAST databases on a prepared GCP instance, use the comand
   `docker run --rm ncbi/blast update_blastdb.pl --showall pretty --source gcp`
* Use `update_blastdb.pl` to download the databases you need.  
* Example (note that GCP is specified as source, `BLASTDB_DIR` is defined and points at a directory that
    exists): 
    ```
    docker run --rm -v $BLASTDB_DIR:/blast/blastdb:rw -w /blast/blastdb ncbi/blast update_blastdb.pl --source gcp swissprot_v5
    ```
            
* Use `blastdbcmd` to interrogate the databases.
  * Summary of database: `blastdbcmd -db swissprot_v5 -info`
    > full command with docker is `docker run --rm -v $BLASTDB_DIR:/blast/blastdb:ro -w /blast/blastdb ncbi/blast blastdbcmd -db swissprot_v5 -info`

* Print accession, scientific name, and title for all entries: 
  `blastdbcmd -db swissprot_v5 -entry all -outfmt "%a %S %t"`
            
* Print accession and title for all human (taxid 9606) entries:
  `blastdbcmd -db swissprot_v5 -taxids 9606 -outfmt "%a %t"`
            
* Print accession, scientific name, and title for `P02185`:
  `blastdbcmd -db swissprot_v5 -entry p02185 -outfmt "%a %S %t"`

BLAST programs (this is a brief summary)
    
* `blastn`: DNA-DNA comparisons. Add `-task blastn` to make it more sensitive (and much slower). Default is megablast.
    
* `blastp`: protein-protein comparisons. Add `-task blastp-fast` to make it faster (longer words for initial matches) and only marginally less sensitive.

* `blastx`: (translated) DNA query-protein comparison. Add `-task blastx-fast` to make it faster.

* `tblastn`: protein query-(translated) DNA database comparison. Add `-task tblastn-fast` to make it faster.
    
* `rpsblast`: protein-PSSM comparison (PSSM is position-specific-scoring matrix). Great for identifying domains in your proteins.

* `rpstblastn`: (translated) DNA-PSSM comparison. Great for identifying domains in your translated DNA queries.
    
* `magicblast`: mapper for DNA-DNA comparisons. Can quickly map reads (even long PacBio ones) and identify splice sites.
  > Documentation at [https://ncbi.github.io/magicblast/](https://ncbi.github.io/magicblast/)

* You can extract FASTAs from a BLAST DB:
  `blastcmd -db <db_name> -entry all -outfmt %f -out <file_name>`

* You can blast against a subset of a db using a:
  * gi list: `-gilist <file>`
  * Negative gi list: `-negative_gilist <file>`

### Other tools pre-installed on your VMs (including non-NCBI tools)

> `$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem`

6. Generate a password hash (you will use the same password to access your jupyter notebook remotely)

> `$ ipython` 
> `In [1]: from IPython.lib import passwd`
> `In [2]: passwd()                                                                             
>  `   Enter password: 
>  `   Verify password: 
> `Out[3]: 'sha1:0bebc03bff39:25b6ebdkrisbf0cc3f7e6c8e0f82fcbe9e66801a'
> Copy the `sha` string for later use.

7. Edit `.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` to add the following
> Note the path to your mycert.pem file from step 5.
> Note the `sha` hash from step 6
